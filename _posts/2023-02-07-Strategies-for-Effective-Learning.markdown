<h1>What is learning?</h1>
<p>Learning is the process of acquiring new skills through experience or study and developing the ability to recall and apply them later.</p>

<h2>And how to maximize learning?</h2>
<p>To maximize learning effectiveness, it's important to adopt active learning techniques such as engaging with material and receiving feedback. This is more effective than passive learning techniques that lack engagement and feedback.</p> 
<p>Effective learners also seek out challenges and use spaced repetition to reinforce their learning over time, rather than relying on cramming.</p>

<p>Happy Effective Learning!</p>
